## Bio

Specializing in computational biology and machine learning, I am working on understanding the complex relationships that allow living things to adapt to new environments, form emergent structures and behaviors, and behave (semi) intellegently.

At a high level this entails asking: what are the fundamental principles of evolution that allow new behaviors and structures to develop in biological organisms? And, how can we apply these principles to better design synthetic biological systems with traits that benefit humanity and sustainable world?

When not torturing my brain with challenging questions, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, playing board games, photography, and cooking spicy food.
